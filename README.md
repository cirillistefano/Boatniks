So, i have a new version of the Regatta like game with fixed angle and no more wheels to turn, that definitely, i discovered as a buggy program, also i changed the repository's name to a more suited wit. It's a two players game: player 1 keys are LeftArrow and right arrow in the way of "bolina" and Up and Down arrows in the way of "poppa". These keys are for player 2: "a" and "d" in the "bolina"'s path and "w" and "s" in the "poppa"'s path. Also is changed the screen's definition, now 800x600 and substantially it means is a QB64 program.
