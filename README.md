It's a two players game: player 1 keys are LeftArrow and right arrow in the way of "bolina" and Up and Down arrows in the way of "poppa". These keys are for player 2: "a" and "d" in the "bolina"'s path and "w" and "s" in the "poppa"'s path.The screen's definition is 800x600 and it means, substantially it's a QB64 program.
Changes in the new version:
1) Added a more reliable MultiKey's routine.
