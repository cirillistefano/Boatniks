Still a lot of stuffs to do.
It's a two players game: player 1 keys are PgUp and PgDown to move the wheel, LeftArrow and right arrow in the way of "bolina" and Up and Down arrows in the way of "poppa". These keys are for player 2:"q" and "z" to move the wheel, "a" and "d" in the "bolina"'s path and "w" and "s" in the "poppa"'s path. If you really want to play "boatnik", take a look at the Wiki page.
